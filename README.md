# README


Initial replit prompt:

Create a single-page lunar lander game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game should display a simple 2D lunar lander that the player can control using keyboard arrows (up for thrust, left/right for rotation). The lander should be affected by gravity and have limited fuel. The goal is to land safely on a flat surface at the bottom of the screen without crashing. Show the lander's velocity, fuel, and a message for win/lose conditions. Keep the code in a single HTML file, and use simple shapes (no external assets). Add comments to explain key parts of the code.
